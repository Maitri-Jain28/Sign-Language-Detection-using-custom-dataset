# Sign Language Detection with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe

## Overview
This project uses **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Mediapipe** to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. A **custom dataset** of hand gestures is used to train a model capable of recognizing various sign language symbols.

---

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection and recognition.
- Customizable dataset for training new gestures.
- Extensible and easy-to-use pipeline.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: Video and image processing.
- **Mediapipe**: Hand detection and tracking.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Gesture recognition model.

---
## How It Works
- **Hand Detection**: Mediapipe detects hand landmarks from the video feed.
- **Feature Extraction**: The detected landmarks are processed into feature vectors.
- **Gesture Recognition**: A trained neural network classifies the gestures and maps them to sign language symbols.

## Applications
- **Education**: Helping individuals learn sign language.
- **Accessibility**: Assisting those with hearing or speech impairments.
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Enabling gesture-based interfaces.
